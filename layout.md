Layout on phones:
 - Conditions, Harm
 - Potential
 - Labels
 - Special (Shame, Doom, Drives, ...)
 - Advancements, Moves
 - Names [Character Name gets a floating bar at the top], Playbook, Powers
 - Character Selector
Each bullet gets its own card and may take up the entire width of the screen.

The considerations are as follows:
Conditions are almost certainly the most frequently modified section of
a character sheet, followed by Potential. Potential *may* be marked more,
or at least similarly, often, but it is far less impactful in-session.
Harm is grouped with Conditions because of its similarity to them,
as a status effect, in addition to the similar conditions in which it tends
to be marked.

Potential precedes Labels for two reasons: frequency of use and significantly
lesser size.

After Labels is the Special section, whose frequency of use differs greatly
between Playbooks- but usually is on the order of once per session.

Advancements

Names, Playbook, Powers

The Character Selector is more important than the Names section,
so it might seem at first a good idea to place it higher in the page than it.
However, it is easier, in my estimation, to scroll really fast until I reach
the bottom of the page than it is to scroll to a place slightly above.

The situation on larger screens is easier: I don't care.
