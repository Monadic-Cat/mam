This is a fan made (I'm a fan) companion app for the MASKS games made by
Magpie Gaming.

The source code is available on [GitHub!](https://github.com/Monadic-Cat/mam)

If you have any questions, feel free to open an issue there or pop me an [email.](mailto:greenmonadcat@gmail.com)
Assuming I'm not inundated with spam, I'll respond within a few days.

Now then, this is where I tell you what this thing stores on your
machine. *dramatic pause*

Character information. I don't exactly have a reason to put anything
else in your browser, do I?
Go ahead and read the code if you want- this site comes with source maps.

The structure of the stored stuff is in `types.js` (I use [Flowtype](flow.org)).
The actual storing of stuff is done in `store.js`.

Now, there are some attribution notices I'm required to show for the
JavaScript libraries I'm using in this website.
They can be found here: [disclaimer](/disclaimer).
